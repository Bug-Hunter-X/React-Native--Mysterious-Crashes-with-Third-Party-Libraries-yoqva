The solution involves several steps: 
1. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that the library is correctly installed using `npm list` or `yarn why <library_name>`. 
2. **Check Native Module Links:** If the library requires native modules (common for features interacting directly with device hardware), ensure they are properly linked.  This might involve using React Native's linking utilities or manual linking (depending on the library's instructions). 
3. **Resolve Dependency Conflicts:** Use tools like `npm dedupe` or `yarn why` to identify and resolve potential conflicts between the third-party library and other dependencies in your `package.json`. 
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes, perform a clean build of your React Native project (`yarn clean` or `npm run clean` if such scripts are available) followed by a complete rebuild to ensure all changes are correctly integrated. 
5. **Console Debugging:** Consider enabling more verbose logging within the library or using debugging tools such as React Native Debugger to obtain more detailed information, even if the library itself doesn't explicitly provide extensive error messages. 
6. **Examine Library Documentation:**  Carefully review the library's documentation for known issues, troubleshooting tips, and any specific installation or setup requirements for your particular platform (iOS and/or Android).
