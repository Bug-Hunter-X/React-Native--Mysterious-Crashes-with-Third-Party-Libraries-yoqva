This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in React Native: difficulties integrating third-party libraries.  The bug manifests as sporadic crashes or unexpected behavior without direct error messages in the console. The solution involves a thorough check of library installation, linking of native modules, and conflict resolution between dependencies. The `ThirdPartyLibraryBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, whereas `ThirdPartyLibraryFix.js` provides the solution.  This example uses a hypothetical library but the principles apply across various third-party packages.
